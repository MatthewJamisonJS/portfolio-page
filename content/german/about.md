# About Me

Hi, I'm Matthew Jamison â€” a full-stack developer passionate about building elegant, efficient web applications and exploring the intersection of technology and creativity.

## What I Do

I specialize in:

- **Full-Stack Web Development**: Building robust applications with Ruby on Rails and modern JavaScript frameworks
- **Python Development**: Data processing, automation, and AI tooling integration
- **AI & Automation**: Leveraging modern AI tools and APIs to create intelligent applications
- **System Design**: Architecting scalable, maintainable solutions

## Technology Stack

- Python (Django, Flask)

- Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap

### DevOps & Tools

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I create ambient and experimental electronic music. You can find my work on [Bandcamp](https://matthewjjamison.bandcamp.com/), where I explore soundscapes and atmospheric compositions.

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Clean, maintainable code**: Writing code that others (and future me) can understand
- **Continuous learning**: Technology evolves, and so should we
- **Practical solutions**: Choosing the right tool for the job, not just the newest
- **User-focused design**: Building things that people actually want to use
