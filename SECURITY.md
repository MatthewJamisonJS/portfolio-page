## Response Expectations

- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- We will provide updates on the status of the vulnerability assessment within one week
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue as quickly as possible
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had time to address it
