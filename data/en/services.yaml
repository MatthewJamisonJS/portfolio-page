# FAQ content
faq:
  - question: "How long does a typical project take?"
    answer: "Project timelines vary based on scope and complexity. Starter packages typically take 2-3 weeks, Professional packages 4-6 weeks, and Enterprise projects 8-12 weeks. I provide detailed timelines during the consultation phase and maintain regular communication throughout development."

  - question: "What's included in post-launch support?"
    answer: "Post-launch support includes bug fixes, minor content updates, and technical assistance. The duration varies by package: 1 month for Starter, 3 months for Professional, and 6 months for Enterprise. Extended support packages are available for purchase."

  - question: "Do you offer payment plans?"
    answer: "Yes! I offer flexible payment structures. Typically, projects are split into milestones: 30% upfront, 40% at midpoint, and 30% upon completion. For Enterprise projects, we can arrange custom payment schedules that align with your budget and project phases."

  - question: "Can I upgrade my package later?"

    answer: "While I don't directly provide hosting, I can guide you through selecting the best hosting solution for your needs and handle the entire deployment process. I work with platforms like Vercel, Netlify, AWS, and traditional hosting providers to ensure your site is fast, secure, and reliable."
