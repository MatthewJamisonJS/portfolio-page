## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I choose the right service?**
Let's talk for 15 minutes. I'll ask about your goals and recommend honestly‚Äîeven if that means I'm not the right fit.

**What if I'm not technical?**
That's why training is included. I explain everything in plain English and make sure you're confident before we're done.

**Can you work with my industry?**
I've served restaurants, agencies, e-commerce stores, portfolios, SaaS companies, and app launches. If you have a business goal, I can help achieve it.

**What about changes after launch?**
Training covers most updates you'll need. For bigger changes, we'll discuss scope and pricing transparently before starting.

**Why not hire an agency?**
No overhead means lower costs. Direct access means faster communication. One person genuinely invested in your success.

**What if my budget is tight?**
Reach out anyway. Sometimes we can phase work, adjust scope, or find creative solutions that work for where you are now.
